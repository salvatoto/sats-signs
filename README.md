Crowdsourced project to design dope "Bitcoin Accepted" signs for brick-and-mortar stores

## Idea

Create ¨Bitcoin Accepted Here¨ signs for small businesses that accept Bitcoin, uniquely designed for their business.

Inspired by Bill Hill’s presentation at Adopting Bitcoin on onboarding small businesses: https://youtu.be/3YHnEpJT6Cg. At 11:23 he talks about how one of the things they did was create “Bitcoin Accepted” signs custom designed for each shop.

## Proposal

Idea is to scale and crowdsource this. This will all be offered FREE to the shops.

BASIC
1. Create an online presence where small businesses can ask for a logo.

2. Generate a selection of images through a mix of crowdsourcing, AI image generation, possibly even paid work for Bitcoin designers.

ADVANCED
3. A local community member will create a list of in country/in community places where the signs and stickers can be printed.

4. If we have a fund, we can cover the cost of printing.


## Notes

- [] Logos can be listed on the website and merchants can re-use logos with modifications if desired.
- [] This can be the beginning of a bigger shared resource for Bitcoin Communities!
